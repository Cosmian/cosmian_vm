# Cosmian VM

Cosmian VM allows you to deploy an application on a cloud provider instance, running in a confidential context with verifiability at any time.

- **No binary modification**: the application doesnâ€™t need any third party library or any specific adaptation
- **Simplicity is gold**: reduce at its minimum the number of manual actions the user has to do to spawn a Cosmian VM
- **Confidentiality**: the application runs in a Trusted Execution Environment (encrypted memory)
- **Verifiability**: a user is able to verify the integrity of the system (OS & application) at any time

## Setup flow

A confidential VM is instanciated from a cloud provider platform, including Cosmian VM solution. After installing all dependencies, a snapshot of the VM is done and integrity checks can be performed on the running application, in order to verify the running code and infrastructure.

## Verification steps

Cosmian verification process is performed by the admin sys, requesting on the running confidential VM, and checks:

- IMA measurement list (containing the list of executed file's hash digest)
- TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) elements to provide assurance that the code is running on secure and confidential hardware
- TPM (Trusted Platform Module) elements to attest a TEE and the integrity of the system (IMA)

## Coverage

Cosmian VM supports these kinds of TEE:
- Intel SGX
- Intel TDX
- AMD SEV

## Compile and run tests

The Cosmian VM agent contains two majors binaries:
- `cosmian_vm_agent` designed to be deployed on the Cosmian VM. It serves on demand the collaterals used to verify the trustworthiness of the Cosmian VM such as the IMA file, the TEE quote or the TPM quote
- `cosmian_vm` is a CLI designed to be used on your own host. It queries the `cosmian_vm_agent` in order to get the collaterals used to verify the trustworthiness of the Cosmian VM

You can compile and test these both binaries as follow:

```sh
$ cargo build
$ cargo test
```

## Setup a Cosmian VM on SEV/TDX

A Cosmian VM image containing a full configured environment can be built as follow:

```sh
$ cargo build
$ cp target/debug/cosmian_vm_agent packer
$ cd packer
$ # Create a service account on GCP and download the JSON file
$ # https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?cloudshell=false&project=MY_PROJECT
$ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/user/my-project-d42061429e6a.json"
$ packer build gcp.pkr.hcl
```

This image:
- contains the fully configured IMA
- contains the fully configured SELinux 
- disables the auto-update (to avoid any modification of the Cosmian VM after having snapshoted it)
- contains the fully configured `cosmian_vm_agent` and a nginx to redirect queries to it
- contains a script `cosmian_vm_post_install.sh` to finalize the configuration of the Cosmian VM after installing the image on a fresh environment. It will setup the SSL certificate and finalize the configuration of the nginx & `cosmian_vm_agent`

## Start a Cosmian VM on SEV/TDX

Now, instanciate a VM based on the built image. After having instanciated it: 
- Edit your DNS register to point to that VM and configure the networking/users on GCP
- On the VM, run `sudo cosmian_vm_post_install.sh YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME` 

The Cosmian VM Agent relies on a configuration file located at `/etc/cosmian_vm/agent.toml`. Feel free to edit it. 
A minimal configuration file is:

```toml
[agent]
pem_certificate = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/cosmianvm.cosmian.dev/cert.pem"
```


Note, that you can start/restart/stop the Cosmian VM Agent as follow:

```sh
$ # If the surpervisor configuration file has been editer, reload it first
$ supervisorctl reload cosmian_vm_agent
$ supervisorctl start cosmian_vm_agent
$ # Or
$ supervisorctl restart cosmian_vm_agent
$ # Or
$ supervisorctl stop cosmian_vm_agent
 ```

You can now install any packages or applications you want on the VM. 

Your VM is now set and ready.

## Usage

Then on your localhost, when you are sure your VM is fully configured and should not change anymore:

1. Create a snapshot (once)
   
```sh
$ cosmian_vm snapshot --url https://cosmianvm.cosmian.dev
```

2. Verify the current state of the machine

```sh
$ cosmian_vm verify --url https://cosmianvm.cosmian.dev --snapshot cosmian_vm.snapshot  
```

## Provide secrets

Before snapshotting the Cosmian VM, you can also provide a secret file to an application running inside the Cosmian VM. 

Prior to send the secrets, you should have configured the  `app` section in the `agent.toml` as follow:

```toml
[agent]
pem_certificate = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/cosmianvm.cosmian.dev/cert.pem"

[app]
service_app_name = "cosmian_helloworld"
decrypted_folder = "/mnt/cosmian_vm/data"
encrypted_secret_app_conf = "/etc/cosmian_vm/app_secrets.json"
```

In that example, [`cosmian_helloworld`](https://github.com/Cosmian/helloworld-service) is the name of the application (as a `supervisor` service). 
- `decrypted_folder` stands for the directory where the application expects to find its decrypted configuration file (which should be located into an encrypted RAMFS)
- `encrypted_secret_app_conf` stands for the location where `cosmian_vm_agent` stores the application configuration encrypted

Now, you can provide the secret file from your localhost to the Cosmian VM as follow:

```sh
$ cosmian_vm app init --url https://cosmianvm.cosmian.dev --conf secrets.json
```

The configuration file can be anything the application expects. Here, a json file. 

The configuration file will be encrypted by the `cosmian_vm_agent` and stored encrypted in the value set in `encrypted_secret_app_conf`. 
A decrypted version of this file will be saved in the value set in `decrypted_folder`. The `init` subcommand will finally start the application identified in `service_app_name` field. 

The key used to encrypt this file will be prompted in the output of the `init` command if you don't provide it as an arg of the command using `--key`.

If you call again `init` the previous secrets file is overwritten. 

Note that `cosmian_vm_agent` won't save the key on its side. Therefore, in the event of a reboot, you need to provide the key to decrypt the secrets. To do so, use: 

```sh
$ cosmian_vm app restart --url https://cosmianvm.cosmian.dev --key abcdefghij0123456789abcdefghij0123456789abcdefghij0123456789
```

The `restart` subcommand will finally start the application identified in `service_app_name` field.
